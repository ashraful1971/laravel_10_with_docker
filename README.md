## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- git pull https://github.com/ashraful1971/laravel_10_with_docker.git
- docker build -t my_laravel .
- docker run -d -p 8080:8000 --name laravel_project my_laravel
- visit http://localhost:8080
- all done!
